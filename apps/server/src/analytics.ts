/**
 * Server-side analytics — the seam every business event the instance reports
 * goes through.
 *
 * Two guarantees shape it, and both are structural rather than a matter of
 * remembering:
 *
 * **Readers stay unwatched.** Nothing here ever runs in a reader's browser: a
 * served draft carries no script source of any kind, so there is no analytics
 * JavaScript to carry. Serving a draft is deliberately not an event — a visit
 * moves a retention clock in the database and is never reported here — and no
 * event carries a source address, a reason a reader typed, page content, a
 * filename, or a URL. What ships is the shape of what happened: ids, sizes,
 * counts, and states.
 *
 * **A user's request never depends on it.** `capture` returns nothing, throws
 * nothing, and is never awaited. A failing analytics backend is a warning in
 * the log and no difference at all to the response — which is why the guard
 * lives in the base class here rather than at each of the seven call sites.
 *
 * An instance with no API key configured gets the disabled seam, which accepts
 * every event and reports none. Private instances get no analytics by default
 * and never build a client they did not ask for.
