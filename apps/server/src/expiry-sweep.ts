/**
 * The expiry sweep — the job that makes draft expiry real.
 *
 * A draft whose retention clock has run out already stops serving and refuses
 * updates; the row and its stored HTML are still there, still costing storage,
 * still counting against its creator's draft quota. The sweep is what finishes
 * the job: for each expired, unpinned draft it hard-deletes the record and then
 * the content behind it. There is no recovery — republishing is the way back.
 *
 * Order is deliberate. The record goes first, so a failure between the two
 * halves leaves unreachable objects rather than a live draft with no content;
 * an orphaned object costs storage, a contentless draft costs the reader the
 * page. Everything else follows from re-reading the database: a run is
 * idempotent, two runs overlapping is safe, and a draft pinned mid-run stays.
 *
 * There is no scheduler seam here on purpose. The sweep is a plain call on the
 * app, driven by the same injected clock the rest of the hosting seam uses, so
 * a test winds time forward and runs it. Deciding *when* to run is wiring, and
 * lives in `start.ts`.
