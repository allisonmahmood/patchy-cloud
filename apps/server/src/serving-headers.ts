/**
 * The serving guarantees every published draft is delivered under.

 * Standing rule: draft URLs are never bot-blocked, challenged, or put behind a
 * WAF human-check. Pages are share-a-link-never-be-found — `X-Robots-Tag:
 * noindex` keeps them out of search results, and that is the only measure taken
 * against discovery. Anything that makes an agent fail to fetch a pasted link is
 * a defect, not a defence.
 *
 * Readers are unwatched: no cookies, no auth or session on the serving host, and
 * a fully locked CSP with no script sources of any kind (no analytics JS).
 *
 * Cache lifetimes are keyed to URL shape and are never coupled to a CDN purge
 * API. A version URL names immutable content, so it is cached for a year; the
 * latest-draft URL follows the draft, so it gets a short window that lets an
 * update land on its own.
