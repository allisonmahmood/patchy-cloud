- [ ] Added or updated tests covering this change

## Release impact

<!--
Area and size labels are applied automatically. This section is the part no
automation can decide: whether the change breaks anyone already running Patchy
Cloud, which is what an upgrade note has to cover.
-->

Tick exactly one.

- [ ] **Breaking** — requires action from anyone already running this
- [ ] **Not breaking** — no action required

<!--
"Breaking" means a change to the CLI's public behaviour, the API contract, the
database schema, or the configuration format that existing users must react to.

If breaking, describe the break and the upgrade path below. If not breaking,
say briefly why -- "lockfile only", "dev dependency", "internal refactor".
Leaving both boxes unticked is not an answer; it reads as "not filled in".
